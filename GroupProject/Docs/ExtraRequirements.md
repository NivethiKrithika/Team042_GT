# Extra Requirements

Requirements that do not fit the use case model such as non-functional requirements.

> 1. Handle fault tolerance by having proper try catch blocks in code in code areas that could be prone to run time errors. Also the constraints in GUI restricts the user from entering wrong values to avoid the application from crashing. Return types are validated and suitably handled for the proper functioning of the app. There are condition checks at many parts of the code  to prevent the system from entering into a faulty state. Some automated test cases also perform tests to confirm the correct functioning of the app. 

> 2. The application will be user friendly with intuitive design. The buttons will be directly related to their actions for ease of comprehension. The error messages convey the user of the expected user input and all the visual elements are chosen appropriately to make the system more interactive.All the buttons and text fields are simple and the purpose can be easily understood. The user can navigate well between the pages. The user can easily quit from the current page since the Return to Main Menu option is present in all the pages.

> 3. The database will be persistent and have previous states of the existing data be retrieved when the application is re-run.This enables the user to not lose data when the system crashes.
