# Test Plan

Version 2.0
1.Updated with initial test plan results



## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

We will use automated Junit tests to validate the backend logic in the application and UI testing will be performed manually. The application coding and unit testing will be parallelized. After the application is developed completely, integration and system testing will be performed to check for system correctness and to check if all the components fit well together. If the actual result deviates from the expected result, details of the same will be captured in the bug tracking system. This enables all the developers in our team to know the status of the test cases and  fix the failed test cases.

### 1.2 Test Selection

Functionality testing, recoverability testing, performance testing, usability testing will be performed as part of system testing. Functional testing will be conducted to test if the functional requirements of the system  are satisfied. Since scalability is not a requirement, non-functional testing will be performed to check for  performance lags and usability. The unit test cases in Section 2 validate all the functional requirements of the application.Since all our team members have code access, once black box testing is completed, white box testing will also be conducted on the system and additional test cases will be added accordingly. This extensive testing approach can help us to find hidden errors in the application.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

We will make sure that the test cases are comprehensive that cover all the requirements of the application. Tests will be written at different levels, eg. unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests to capture different responsibilities of the system. Also, after coding, we will perform white box testing to identify critical problem areas of the system and write additional test cases.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bugs that are detected while testing can be logged in Github issues. Using Github issues, the bugs can be categorized using labels and assigned to one or more developers in our team. 

### 1.5 Technology

Unit testing is performed using automated Junit tests to test the backend code. GUI is tested manually. System testing can be performed using Android emulators.
