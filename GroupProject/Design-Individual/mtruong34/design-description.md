First I have an object class Job which consist of all the requirements in the document (title, company, location, etc...). From the Job class, the get the information method is available. Each job can have one or more locations and jobs can also have the same location. I have a separate class for Location which consist of city and state. Another class I have is the ComparisonSettings which consist of attributes of weight of salary/bonus/benefits/stipend/stock. There is a method to get the weights of the comparison setting. In the controller class is where all the actions can be done. This is where a job can be created or updated. The comparison settings is also being set in the controller class. There will be an arraylist of jobs and the comparison settings will be stored in the controller class.
